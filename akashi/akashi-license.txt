SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

Comment:
I, Martin Erik Werner ("arand") have had a longer email discussion with Ed
Merrit (the Author of Akashi) regarding the license of the Akashi font
available from Ten By Twenty, and the conclusion is that the Akashi font is
distibuted under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) 1.1
Copyright © 2007 - 2013 Ten by Twenty.

The concluding bits from the email conversation are reproduced below:

Hi Martin,
I've updated the footer of the site to state that all fonts are
distributed under the SIL Open Font License.

Hi Ed,

(I was using the alias "Arand Nash" with the ienorand@gmail.com email
previously. I've since switched over to using the birth name)

We are currently using your typeface "Akashi" for several pieces of
"word art" and in the logo of the Free and Open Source FPS game Red
Eclipse <http://redeclipse.net>.

It's an awesome font which we really like! :)

I previously contacted you regarding a clarification of the font
license, since we tend to be a bit picky with our licenses in order to
remain fully open source, the clarification I got at that point we
deemed fine.

However, it seems that some distributions, into which we would very much
like Red Eclipse to be accepted, wants a more formal license for things
(explicitly allowing use, modification, and redistribution with or
without modification).

(The discussion in question is on a bug report for the game package in
the linux distribution Fedora:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=895947)

Would it be possible to get a more formal clarification of the license
for the Akashi font covering those bits, or more preferably, would it be
possible to use the Akashi font under a well-known license like the
OFL-1.1, since this would make sure to avoid all the misinterpretation
pitfalls of a custom-written license.

Thanks!
